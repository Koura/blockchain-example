# Blockchain example

This is a Rust implementation of a simple blockchain example based on DanielÂ van Flymen's blog post [Learn Blockchains by Building One](https://medium.com/p/117428612f46).

The example was written purely out of curiosity and for educational purposes. We advice not to run this in a production setup.
